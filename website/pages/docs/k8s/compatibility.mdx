# Compatibility Matrix for Consul Kubernetes and Consul 

## Supported Versions

Consul Kubernetes is released through Consul Helm. For every release of Consul Kubernetes, a new version of the Consul Kubernetes 
Helm chart and Consul Kubernetes binary is released through the HashiCorp Helm repository. It is best practice to utilize versions of 
the Helm chart that are released with Consul Kubernetes binaries as there may be dependencies between the binary and Helm chart. 

| Consul Version      | Compatible Consul Helm Versions  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1.8.x               | v0.22 - v0.24.1                  |
| 1.7.x               | v0.17 - v0.21                    |
| 1.6.x               | v0.10 - v0.16.2                  |
