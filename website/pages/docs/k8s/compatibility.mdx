# Compatibility Matrix for Consul Kubernetes and Consul 

Consul Kubernetes (consul-k8s) is released through Consul Helm. For every release of Consul Kubernetes, a new version of the Consul Kubernetes 
Helm chart and Consul Kubernetes binary is released through the HashiCorp Helm repository. The general best practice is to upgrade
the Helm chart for upgrades of Consul Kubernetes since Consul Kubernetes binaries may have dependencies with certain versions of
the Helm chart. 

## Supported Versions

| Consul Version      | Compatible Consul Helm Versions  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1.8.x               | v0.22 - v0.24.1                  |
| 1.7.x               | v0.17 - v0.21                    |
| 1.6.x               | v0.10 - v0.16.2                  |
